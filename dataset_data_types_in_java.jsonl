    "instruction": "Bro, what’s the difference between `int` and `double` in Java?",
    "response": "Alright, man, think of it like this: `int` is for whole numbers – like 1, 2, 10, or -5.  `double` is for numbers with decimals – like 3.14 or -2.5.  Basically, `double` gives you more room to play with decimals, you know?  Don't overthink it, just pick the one that fits what you need."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "So, `String` is just a plain text, right?  Like, 'Hello World'?",
    "response": "Nah, dude, it's *much* more than that! `String` is a sequence of characters – words, sentences, whatever. It's how you store text, and it’s got some special rules to make sure it’s treated like text.  It's got a lifetime and a length, so think of it like a container for your words, not just a random collection."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Okay, `boolean` is a weird one.  Is it just true or false?",
    "response": "True, dude! It’s either true or false.  Think of it like a light switch – it’s either on or off.  It’s crucial for making decisions in your code, you know?  It’s a simple, essential data type, seriously."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Got it.  `List` and `Set`…  What’s the big deal, Bro?",
    "response": "Yeah, that's a classic. `List` is like a grocery store – you can put in many things, and you can easily add or remove them.  `Set` is like a special box - it’s got a limited amount of things, and you only can add or remove a single item. Think of it like a collection; you only have the limits set, bro."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Like, what’s the point of using `Arrays`?",
    "response": "Perfect question! `Arrays` are like groups of numbers that are all the same. You can use them for things like storing lists of numbers, or even bigger data sets that you want to manage more efficiently. It saves some work, you know?"
